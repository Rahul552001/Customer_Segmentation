# Customer_Segmentation
The main objective of this project is to segment customers into different groups using their behavior and demographic data. This allows businesses to better understand their customers and create personalized marketing strategies. The K-Means Clustering algorithm is used to identify natural groupings among the customers.
# Features
+ Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing customer data for clustering.
+ Customer Segmentation: Apply the K-Means Clustering algorithm to create customer segments.
+ Cluster Evaluation: Use techniques like the Elbow method and Silhouette Score to determine the optimal number of clusters.
+ Visualization: Visualize the clusters and key insights using plots.
# Model
+ K-Means Clustering
+ Algorithm: K-Means clustering is a popular unsupervised machine learning algorithm used to partition data into K distinct, non-overlapping clusters.
+ Distance Metric: The algorithm uses Euclidean distance to assign points to the nearest cluster center.
+ Cluster Centers: The algorithm iteratively updates cluster centers until the clusters stabilize.
# Optimal Cluster Selection
+ Elbow Method: Used to find the optimal number of clusters by plotting the Within-Cluster Sum of Squares (WCSS) against the number of clusters.
